# waketor

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ‘waketor’ is to make Base-R vectors, *i.e., character,
factor, integer, or DateTime*, become more informative by themselves. By
just calling them, continuous variables like integer/numeric vector
should provide you with distribution data, while categorical variables
should be tabulated.

The idea will be made possible by utilizing @vctrs packages.

## Installation

You can install the released version of waketor from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("waketor")
# Not yet
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Songyosr/waketor")
```

## Example

This is a basic example that shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(waketor)
## basic example code
```
